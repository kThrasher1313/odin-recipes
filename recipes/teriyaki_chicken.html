    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine mirin and sake. Bring to a boil and let cook for 60s to burn off the alcohol. Add the soy sauce and sugar, stir until the sugar disolves. Add grated garlic, ginger, and bouillon powder. SImmer for about 10 minutes until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl to cool to room temp.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice until the water runs clear and cook in a rice cooker or pot.</li>
        <li>Debone the chicken and trim excess skin. Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a container, cover with most of the cooled sauce (reserve some for basting), and refrigerate for 30 min to 6 hours</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet with olive oil over medium-high heat. Saute onions and peppers with a pinch of salt for about 8 minutes until softened but still crunchy</li>
        <li>Place broccoli and thinly sliced carrots in a steamer basket over simmering water for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Whisk together the veggie sauce ingredients and drizzle over the steamed broccoli and carrots; top with sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken thighs in the air fryer basket skin side down adn don't overcrowd. Air fry at 400 F for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook for another 6 to 10 minutes until charred and fully cooked. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before slicing into strips</li>
        <li>Layer a bowl with rice, followed by sliced chicken, sauteed peppers/onions, and steamed broccoli/carrots. Drizzle with extra reserved teriyaki sauce and garnish with green onions and sesame seeds</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you don't want to use an air fryer you can ge tt=similar results on the stove top or oven</li>
        <li>For the stovetop method: heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat and place the chicken skin side down undistirbed for 4-6 minutes until the skin is crispy. Flip the chicken and cook another 5-7 minutes then pour some of the reserved sauce in the pan. Reduce heat to medium and flip the chicken repeatedlu for 1-2 minutes until the suace thickens and covers the meat. Let ti rest for 5 minutes before slicing</li>
        <li>For the oven method: Cook the chicken on a single layered greased baking dish or on a foil lined baking sheet at 400 F for 20-25 min. Halfway through cooking time flip the chicken and brush on more sauce. For an optional charred look turn the oven to broil for th elast 2 minutes, watching closely so the sugar in the sauce doesn't burn</li>
