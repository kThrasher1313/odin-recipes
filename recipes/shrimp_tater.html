    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16oz Red potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 pint Grape tomatoes halved</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs large shrimp peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>5 oz baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 1/2 oz finely grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Quarter the potatoes and toss them with 2 tsp olive oil, italian seasoning, salt, and pepper on a baking sheet</li>
        <li>Roast in the oven for 25-30 min flipping halfway through until golden and tender</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining olive oil and tomatoes to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 min, or until the tomatoes soften and release some of their juices</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, shrimp, and crushed red pepper to the skillet. Sauté the shrimp for 1-2 minutes per side, or until opaque and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach to the skillet in handfuls, stirring after each addition to allow it to wilt.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and sprinkle half the grated Parmesan cheese over the skillet contents. Stir to combine, allowing the cheese to melt slightly.</li>
        <li>Divide the shrimp, sautéed veggies, and spinach between plates. Garnish with the reserved Parmesan cheese and basil ribbons. Serve alongside the roasted red potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
