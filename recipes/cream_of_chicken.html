    <p>About 2 cans worth</p>
    <p>Prep: 5 min, Cook: 10-15 min</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter (45g)</li>
        <li>6 tbsp all purpose flour (45g)</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock (480g)</li>
        <li>1 cup milk (240g)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream (60g)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp kosher salt (4g)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper (1g)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp garlic powder(2g)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp onion powder (2g)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika (1g)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cooked and finely chopped or shredded chicken (100 g)</li>
        <li>Optional 1 tbsp chicken bouillion paste or powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add butter to a medium pot over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in flour until smooth. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, whisking, until it smells nutty but is not browned.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the chicken stock while whisking so no lumps form. Add the milk and heavy cream, whisking until everything is smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and bouillon if using. Bring to a gentle simmer</li>
        <li>Simmer 4 to 7 minutes, stirring often, unitl the mixture is thick and glossy. If it coats the back of the spoon and a finger run through it leaves a clear line, you nailed it.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cooked, finely chopped or shredded chicken. Simmer another 2 to 3 minutes to warm it through.</li>
        <li>Taste and add a little more salt if needed. If it is too thick, whisk in more stock 15 to 30 g (1 to 2 tbsp) at a time. If it is too thin, let it simmer a few minutes longer</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For casseroles, keep it slightly thicker so it behaves like the condensed canned version</li>
        <li>For eating straight as soup, thin with extra warm stock until it hits your desired spoonable consistency</li>
        <li>Use good quality stock or homemade broth, since that is where most of the flavor comes from</li>
    </ul>
