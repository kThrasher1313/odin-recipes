        <li>120g (1/2 cup) finely shredded mild cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>120g (1/2 cup) finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat neutral oil in a medium pot over medium heat</li>
        <li>Add chopped broccoli, grated carrots, and 2g salt</li>
        <li>Saute 4 to 5 minutes until the broccoli has softened slightly and the carrots are fragrant</li>
        <li>Add butter directly into the pot with the vegetables</li>
        <li>Once melted, sprinkle flour over the top</li>
        <li>Stir to coat the vegetables and form a thick roux</li>
        <li>Cook 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in chicken broth until smooth with no lumps</li>
        <li>Add milk and heavy cream and whisk until fully combined</li>
        <li>Stir in remaining salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle simmer on medium low heat</li>
        <li>Cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often, until the soup is thick, glossy, and the broccoli is tender</li>
        <li>Turn heat to low. Add shredded cheese a handful at a time, stirring until completely melted and smooth before adding the next handful</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust salt if needed. If it is too thick, whisk in a little extra stock 20g (1 tbsp) at a time. If it is too thin, simmmer another 2 to 3 minutes until it tightens up.</li>
    </ol>
