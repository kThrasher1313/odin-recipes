        <li>Cook in the oven for 30-35 minutes shaking the tray at 20 min</li>
        <li>If the potatoes are going into the fridge for later splash them with apple cider vinegar to keep the potatoes from being bland later</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, cook the chicken breast in vegeatable oil after seasoning both sides with salt and pepper and patting dry</li>
        <li>After the chicken is cooked fully through using a meat thermometer to check let it sit for 10-20 minutes before cutting into cubes</li>
        <li>Cook 1 cup of quinoa according to the package instructions after rinsing the quinoa</li>
        <li>Assemble the food with quinoa on the bottom, sliced chicken and roasted red potatoes in the middle, then arugula on top</li>
        <li>In a bowl create the dressing by mixing together 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, 2 cloves minced garlic or 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp honey, 1 tsp dried thyme, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Taste the dressing, if it tastes too sharp add a splash of olive oil, if it tastes too bland add salt, if it tastes too acidic add honey</li>
