    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be sure to line your baking trays with parchment so that the cookies are easily removed.</li>
        <li>The milk mixture only needs to boil for one minute. Don't boil it any longer or it can affect the texture of the cookies.</li>
        <li>Mix the dough really well, everything should be incorporated and you can easily do this by hand.</li>
        <li>The cookies will take about 30 minutes to fully set, so be patient!</li>
        <li>Store chocolate no bake cookies in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</li>
    </ul>
