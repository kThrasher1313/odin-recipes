    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dry short-grain/sushi rice (yields 6 cup cooked)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 can drained tuna</li>
        <li>3 tbsp mayo divided</li>
        <li>Sirachia with the mayo for spice</li>
        <li>Squeeze of lemon</li>
        <li>3-4 finely chopped sticks imitation crab</li>
        <li>Garlic powder or old bay</li>
        <li>1 drained pouch/can salmon</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp honey</li>
        <li>5 nori cut in half</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse 1 cup dry short-grain/sushi rice until clear. Cook the rice with a 1:1.1 ratio of water. While the rice is still warm, gently fold in 1 tbsp kewpie (or regular) mayo, 1 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tsp salt. This coats the grain to prevent them from hardening in the fridge.</li>
        <li>In three small bowl mix together the fillings. In a small bowl mix together 1 can drained tuna, 1 tbsp mayo, and a squeeze of lemon. In a different small bowl mix together 3-4 sticks of imitation crab finely chopped, 1 tbsp mayo, and garlic powder or old bay. In a seperate small bowl mix together 1 drained pouch/can salmon, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 tsp honey.</li>
        <li>Let the rice cool until you can handle it comfortably, but do not let it get cold before shaping.</li>
        <li>Set out a bowl of water and a small pile of salt. Wet your hands and rub a pinch of salt on your damp palms to prevent sticking</li>
        <li>Scoop about 1/3 cup of rice onto seran wrap. Create a small indent in the middle. Place 1-2 tsp of your chosen filling into the indent. Fold the rice over on itself using the seran wrap.</li>
        <li>Cup your hands to form a triangle. Squeeze firmly but gently so that it is compressed enough to hold but not mashed</li>
        <li>Put nori on the outside of it and wrap each one tightly in plastic wrap immediately</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The rice is best for 3 days so make enough filling for the week but make more rice halfway through the week if you want more onigiri</li>
    </ul>
