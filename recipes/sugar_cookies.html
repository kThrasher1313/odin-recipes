    <p>Makes 45 cookies</p>
    <p>Prep: 20 min, Cook: 10 min, Total: 30 min</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, measured then sifted</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>3 sticks unsalted butter, softened (1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar + extra for rolling</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the softened butter and sugar in the bowl of your electric mixer. Cream the butter and sugar together on high until light and fluffy, 3-5 minutes. (Don't skimp on the time here.) Then turn the mixer on low and add the eggs and vanilla extract. Scrape the bowl.</li>
        <li>With the mixer running on low, slowly add the flour mixture. Scrape the bowl and beat again for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour some extra sugar into a bowl to coat the cookies. Scoop the dough out and roll into 1-inch balls. The dough should be soft and delicate - don't over-handle. Shake each ball in the sugar bowl to coat, then place on the cookie sheets 2 inches apart. Use the bottom of a drinking glass to press down on each ball, until it's 1/3- to 1/2-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Bake each sheet of sugar cookies for 9-11 minutes, until the edges are slightly golden and the centers are just barely set. Cool completely on the cookie sheets.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips for softer less crispy cookies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bake at 350 instead of 375</li>
        <li>Use 1 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Use 3 large eggs instead of 2</li>
        <li>Use slightly less flour</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-9 minutes instead of 9-11 minutes</li>
        <li>If you want them to stay soft store in an air tight container with a single slice of white bread. The cookies will absorb the moisture from the bread and stay chewier for days</li>
    </ul>
