    <p>Prep:15 min, Cook:6 hours 15 min</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless beef chuck steak</li>
        <li>2 medium onions chopped</li>
        <li>1 can (10 3/4 oz) condensed golden mushroom soup, undiluted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>Hot cooked egg noodles</li>
        <li>Minced parsely, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut steak into 3x1/2 inch strips. In a 5 or 6 qt slow cooker, combine next 9 ingredients. Stir in steak strips. Cook, covered, on low until meat is tender, 6-8 hours</li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a serving dish; keep warm. Skim fat from cooking juices. Mix cornstarch and water until smooth; stir into cooking juices. Cook covered, on high until thickened, 10-15 minutes. Stir in sour cream; pour over beef. Serve with noodles and if desired, minced parsely.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Before putting the meat in the slow cooker, brown it in a pan with a little olive oil over high heat for about 2 min per side</li>
        <li>If the meat comes out dry cut the strips larger. Larger pieces hold onto their internal juices much better</li>
        <li>Make sure the meat is almost entirely submerged in the liquid in the crockpot. If it looks dry in the pot, add a 1/2 cup of beef broth or water at the start. This way the top layer of meat wont steam and dry out</li>
        <li>Adding 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar or even a splash of dry red wine can help soften the beef protein during the long simmer, making the inside feel more tender.</li>
    </ul>
