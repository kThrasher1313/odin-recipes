    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp cheddar cheese powder (the kind from a mac and cheese box or a shaker works best)</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>A pinch of msg (optional)</li>
        <li>A pinch of citric acid (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp tomato powder or grind up sun dried tomatoes (optional)</li>
        <li>Stack of thin corn tortillas cut into 6 or 8 triangles</li>
        <li>Neutral oil spray (avocado or vegetable)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl mix together all the spices and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Preheat the airfryer to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>Lightly spray the triangle tortillas with a neutral oil and season them with the seasoning mix. Flip them and spray the other side adding more seasoning so that both sides are seasoned</li>
        <li>Cook them at 350 degrees F for 5-7 minutes, shaking the basket every 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>As soon as they come out of the air fryer, toss them in a bowl with the remaining seasoning while they are still hot and slightly oily.</li>
        <li>Let them cool completely on a wire rack while they continue to crisp up</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If your tortillas are a little bit dry/stale or have been sitting in the fridge they bake up crispier than fresh moist ones</li>
        <li>You can also cook them in the oven at 350 degrees F for about 8-12 minutes flipping halfway through</li>
    </ul>
