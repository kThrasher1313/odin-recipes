    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Acrylic paint</li>
        <li>Mod podge</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F</li>
        <li>Disolve the salt into a bowl of warm water. Mix in the flour until the consistency is that of play dough. If it is too sticky add more flour and if it is too dry add more water</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into ornaments using your hands or cookie cutters. Poke a circular hole in the top of the ornaments using a straw for a string to go through when hanging them</li>
        <li>Put into the oven for 3-4 hours flipping halfway through</li>
        <li>Let the ornaments cool down then paint with acrylic paint</li>
        <li>After the paint is dry seal with mod podge sealing each side with 2-3 coats</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips for mod podge</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shake well for 1 full minute before starting</li>
        <li>Put cardboard under the ornaments out side or in a well ventilated area</li>
        <li>Hold the can about 8-12 inches away from the ornaments</li>
        <li>Spray in large sweeping motions</li>
        <li>Wait about 15-20 minutes between coats</li>
        <li>Shake the mod podge for a few seconds before each coat</li>
        <li>When fully done spray the mod podge upside down for a few seconds so it doesn't clog for next time</li>
        <li>If you are using glitter make sure to hold the mod podge far enough away so as not to blow away all the glitter</li>
    </ul>
