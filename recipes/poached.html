    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Toast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil (not a rolling boil)</li>
        <li>Add a little bit of white vinegar to the pot to keep the egg proteins strong</li>
        <li>Crack the egg into a small bowl</li>
        <li>Stir the pot of water to make a whirlpool and gently lower the egg into the whirlpool so the whites wrap around themselves</li>
        <li>Once the egg whites are no longer see through use a spoon to gently lift the egg from the bottom so that it doesn't stick</li>
        <li>Let the egg cook for a few min, you can tell if its done if the outside is bouncy to the touch and the insides are still liquid</li>
        <li>Serve on toast and season with salt and pepper</li>
    </ol>
