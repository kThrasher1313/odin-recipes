    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 box refridgerated pie crust</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded swiss or gruyere cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>Roll out the pie crust and use a small circular cookie cutter or the rim of a glass to cut circles. Press them into a greased muffin tin</li>
        <li>Place a pinch of your variation (see tips below) into each crust</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs and milk together then pour the mixture over the fillings until alomst full. Sprinkle cheese on top</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-18 minutes until the centers are set and the crust is golden or the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. The quiches should have a slight jiggle in the center when you take them out</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For spinach and feta use 1/2 cup thawed/squeezed dry spinach. Use crumbled feta instead of swiss. Add a pinch of nutmeg to the custard</li>
        <li>For ham and cheddar use 1/2 cup finely diced cooked ham. Use sharp cheddar instead of swiss. Add a tiny bit of dijon mustard to the egg mix</li>
        <li>If you want it to be extra creamy use heavy cream of half and half instead of regular milk. The fat protects the egg proteins from curdling and getting "weepy"</li>
        <li>If you make the spinach version make sure it is bone-dry. Excess water from the vegetables can actually cause the egg to seperate and feel "dry" or grainy</li>
        <li>If using a silicon muffin tray place on a sturdy metal baking sheet before filling it. Because silicone is an insulator it doesn't transfer heat as fast as metal and you might need to add 2-3 extra minutes to your bake time</li>
    </ul>
